Reproductions of puzzles I've collected over the years.

A work in progress.

# TODO

- Instructions for the Alice Maze
- Instructions for the Sliding Door Maze
- Add color-blind mode to Sliding Door Maze

Color blindness adjustments for the Sliding Door maze:
- #ff3020 -> #F74D37
- #10c010 -> #9DD429
- #30a0f0 -> #27CBEC
- #f040c0 -> #D732F1

These need to be applied to the .png background image.
